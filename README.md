### 4. compilation
submissions are visible live on the google sheet, which is visible as a web page [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR84KWj4El-jYSsEVyM29o6rZwKxO0VVciNMbfi-dfRLUJMiFT8ntGxsYiNo3kuRWsnhuvBRQJ3BQBS/pubhtml?gid=1811324984&single=true).

once all the songs are in for the week and i've gone through and added any missing information, i will compile them (for now) in two places:
